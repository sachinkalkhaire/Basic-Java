Abstraction-it is process to hiding implementation, important details and showing only functionality to the user.
            abstraction achieved by using abstract class and interface (interface achieved abstraction 100% in java)
          1.abstract class 
          2.interface (100% in java)


Interface- 
1.interface is a blue print of a class.
2.it's used to start writing code on requirement level..
   after completion design face class implements interface an improve your code and achieved functionality.    
3.interface support multiple inheritance.
4.interface contains final and static variable by default.
5.interface contains abstract methods.
6.abstract method contains only definition not a body.
7.method in interface by default public.
8.we can defined interface with interface keyword.
9.class extends another class, interface extends another interface and class implements interface..but interface not implements class.
10.we create object of interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
